# Create-a-File-Menu-in-your-GUI
Create an exception called IllegalBulbException (by extending IlegalArgumentException as shown in lecture) and have the constructor of the Bulb throw it. For our purposes, a Bulb is illegal if the wattage is less than 5. Use a try/catch statement to catch this exception in your program, and display the erroneous Bulbs to the console (do not put them in the ArrayList).
